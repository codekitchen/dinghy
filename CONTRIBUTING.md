Want to help with Dinghy? Great! Thanks much.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/dinghy.git

Make sure you base your changes on the `master` branch, not the `latest` release
branch (which is set as the github default just so people see the correct README
version).

You can test your changes locally by calling `./bin/dinghy` instead of the globally-installed dinghy binary.

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].
